# DiceyDelight üé≤‚ú®  

DiceyDelight is an exciting dice-rolling game developed as a school project by a group of students from the University of Fort Hare. This app pits a human player against the computer in a strategic battle of luck and numbers.  

## Game Overview  
In DiceyDelight, players take turns rolling three dice:  
- **Two standard dice** (with numbers 1-6)  
- **One special die** (5 blank sides + 1 star side)  

The **sum of the two standard dice** determines which numbers are eliminated from the player's stack. The **special die** adds an extra twist‚Äîif a **star** is rolled, the player gets a bonus action!  

### How It Works  
1. **Roll the Dice**: The player and computer take turns rolling the three dice.  
2. **Calculate the Sum**: The sum of the two standard dice determines which numbers are removed from the current player's stack.  
3. **Special Die Effect**:  
   - If the **star** appears, the player gets a bonus (e.g., extra turn, double elimination, etc.).  
   - If it‚Äôs **blank**, play continues normally.  
4. **Win Condition**: The first player to eliminate all numbers from their stack wins!  

## Technologies Used  
- **ASP.NET** (Backend)  
- **Xamarin (LLVM)** (Cross-platform mobile development)  
- **Java** (Game logic)  
- **C#** (Core programming)  

## Why We Created This App  
This project was developed as part of our university assignment to demonstrate our understanding of software development, teamwork, and problem-solving. We chose a dice game because:  
‚úÖ It‚Äôs **fun and interactive** for players.  
‚úÖ It combines **luck and strategy**, making gameplay dynamic.  
‚úÖ It allowed us to explore **multi-platform development** (mobile & web).  
‚úÖ It helped us practice **collaboration, version control, and agile methodologies**.
